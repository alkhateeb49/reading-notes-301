* ## JavaScript and jQuery
What is jQuery?
jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

HTML/DOM manipulation
CSS manipulation
HTML event methods
Effects and animations
AJAX

* ## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
* * Greater efficiency

The benefits of pair programming greatly outweigh the costs greatly. Madewithlove engineer Wouter explains how pair programming can be efficient and usefull for your development team.

* * Engaged collaboration

Add a human touch to your communications with our omnichannel customer engagement hub. Build lasting relationships with personalized messaging and smart automation - across the channels your customers prefer. 

* * Learning from fellow students

Pair programming, a common term used in agile work environments, is the practice of two programmers sharing one workstation. At Code Fellows, we learn in groups, which I like to think of as peer programming, which is two (or more) programmers learning from each other in one unified setting.

* * Social skills

Children are just learning the complex skills of cooperating, sharing and communicating with others. Children can be encouraged to practice appropriate social skills in school and at home.

* * Job interview readiness

Some companies prefer to pair program with candidates to get a feel for working with them while gauging their skills. I have been in a couple of those companies, and more often than not, one of my tasks was to be the pair in those interviews.

Starting a new job can be exciting, but it can also be very stressful and overwhelming. Project managers who are new to an organization have the essential skillsets to succeed in their new roles
