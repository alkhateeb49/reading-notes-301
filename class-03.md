* ## Templating with Mustache
* * Javascript Templating

JavaScript templating refers to the client side data binding method implemented with the JavaScript language. This approach became popular thanks to JavaScript's increased use, its increase in client processing capabilities, and the trend to outsource computations to the client's web browser. Popular JavaScript templating libraries are AngularJS, Backbone.js, Ember.js, Handlebars.js, Vue.js and Mustache.js. A frequent practice is to use double curly brackets (i.e. {{key}}) to call values of the given key from data files, often JSON objects.

* * Mustache

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code â€” anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

* ## A Guide to Flexbox

Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

* * Block, for sections in a webpage
* * Inline, for text
* * Table, for two-dimensional table data
* * Positioned, for explicit position of an element

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based).
