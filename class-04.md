* ## RegExr
Many applications and programming languages have their own implementation of regular expressions, often with slight and sometimes with significant differences from other implementations. When two applications use a different implementation of regular expressions, we say that they use different “regular expression flavors”. This quick start explains the syntax supported by the most popular regular expression flavors.

The most basic regular expression consists of a single literal character, such as a. It matches the first occurrence of that character in the string. If the string is Jack is a boy, it matches the a after the J.

This regex can match the second a too. It only does so when you tell the regex engine to start searching through the string after the first match. In a text editor, you can do so by using its “Find Next” or “Search Forward” function. In a programming language, there is usually a separate function that you can call to continue searching through the string after the previous match.

* ## CSS Grid Reference
CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows.

CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance). Flexbox helped out, but it’s intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid actually work very well together). Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.

* ## Responsive design with CSS Grid
CSS grid is now supported in Samsung internet v6.2 and many other modern browsers and has been the answer to many a prayer of web developers everywhere. 

The rest of the position styling in this example has been done using flexbox, as these are one dimensional layouts. Flexbox is still my favourite tool for vertically centering elements on the page.
